DXF to QET ELMT converter V3.0 use SQlite
==============================================================================================================

This converter converts only ASCII dxf files
binary dxf files are not converted.

when having problems with a dxf file, copy paste the log tab into a email
with a description of the problem you have found

if you have a drawing with block inside blocks, open this drawing with a cad program and 
explode this blocks into one level blocks.

==============================================================================================================

A few steps to follow

Click on "Open dxf file" to search the dxf file you want to convert

next click on "Load dxf into DB", this starts splitting and loading the dxf code into the different db tables

is this is don you dont need everityme to do the "load dxf into DB"

you can then click on "Choose DB to proces"

after "Load dxf into DB" or "Choose DB to proces" click on "Create QET elmt" to create a elmt output

you can check this syntax under the tab "ELMT"

Then click on "Save to ELMT file" to store the result into the QET user cymbols folder

if this is not done into the correct folder, checkout the tab settings to change the destination path

The time needed for loading into the DB depents on the amount of lines in the dxf file

21:26:49=> Start loading dxf file into tables 
total lines : 28935
header items :255
tables items :447
blocks items :405
entities items :397
End loading into db 21:31:25

the creation of the ELMT file is faster and depents on the amount of ENTITIES and BLOCKS in the dxf file.
